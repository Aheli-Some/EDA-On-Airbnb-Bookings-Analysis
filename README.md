# EDA-On-Airbnb-Bookings-Analysis
Implementing EDA techniques for analyzing the dataset of Airbnb's New York City (NYC), 2019 to provide valuable insights for both hosts and guests for informed decision-making, contributing to the growth and sustainability of the Airbnb platform and its stakeholders.

Using Pandas for data preprocessing & Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualizations (EDA) to get insights on customers' preferred room type & price range, top locations based on reviews & maximum nights stay, top hostsÂ based on reviews & price, correlation between price and reviews & availability, price trends for room types & locations.

Proposed strategies to optimize listings: Offer rooms within targeted price ranges and tailor property offerings to popular locations and room types.
